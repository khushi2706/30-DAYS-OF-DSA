# Welcome to my 30 Days of DSA Challenge! 🚀

Hey there! Welcome to my journey of diving deep into the world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). 🌟

## Introduction

I've decided to take on this exhilarating 30-day challenge to revise and practice my basic knowledge of DSA, and to dive deeper into its intricacies. Brace yourself as I embark on this thrilling adventure filled with learning, coding, and problem-solving!

## Goals

🎯 My primary goal is to revise and strengthen my understanding of fundamental DSA concepts and techniques.

🔍 I aim to explore a wide array of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more!

💻 Additionally, I'll be revisiting various algorithms including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms.

## Plan of Action

📅 Each day, I'll be dedicating focused time to revise a specific DSA topic or problem.

📚 I'll start by revisiting the basics and gradually progress towards more complex concepts.

🚧 Along the way, I'll be building a solid foundation by practicing coding exercises and solving real-world problems.
